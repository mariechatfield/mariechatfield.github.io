        <p>
            I am a senior at Rice University, where I major in Computer Science and expect to graduate in May 2015. I have experience with front-end web development, particularly single page applications. However, I am enthusiastic about working with new technologies throughout the development stack.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am self-motivated and resourceful, with strong communication skills. An efficient worker, I implement ideas quickly and effectively in individual or group settings.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am currently seeking an entry-level Software Engineering position in the Tech Industry.
