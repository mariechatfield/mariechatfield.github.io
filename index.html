    <p>
        I am a recent alumna of Rice University, where I graduated <i>cum laude</i> with a B.A. in Computer Science this May.
    </p>

    <p>
        This summer, I am continuing to contribute to <a href="http://www.skulpt.org/">Skulpt</a> and <a href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/">CodeSkulptor</a>, programming tools that are used in Coursera MOOCs taught by my mentor <a href="http://www.cs.rice.edu/~rixner/" target="_blank">Dr. Scott Rixner</a>. In July, I will move to the Bay Area to begin a full-time job in the tech industry.

    <p>
        I have experience with front-end web development, particularly single page applications. However, I am enthusiastic about working with new technologies throughout the development stack.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am self-motivated and resourceful, with strong communication skills. An efficient worker, I implement ideas quickly and effectively in individual or group settings.
