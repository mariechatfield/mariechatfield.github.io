# Learn, Solve, Share. Repeat.

I love challenges, learning new technologies, and pushing myself to my limits.
But all of that means nothing if it’s not directed towards solving real problems faced by real people.

#### I’m passionate about working towards a more diverse and inclusive tech industry and community.

I believe that starts with breaking down institutional barriers to entry.
But it also requires all of us leveraging whatever privilege we may have to open doors for others who don’t have the same opportunities.

I work as a software engineer at [Square](https://squareup.com).
I enjoy solving problems throughout our tech stack, improving the consistency and maintainability of our codebases, and having intentional and meaningful discussions with the amazing people that work with and around me.

#### I love teaching, writing, and speaking on technical topics, and strive to make all my content accessible and interesting for all levels of experience and expertise.

Nerding out on implementation details is great; being able to explain those details to someone else is better; giving someone else the foundation they need to teach that topic to another person is better still.

In my free time, I read and write poetry. I love swing dancing and taking walks in Golden Gate Park.
I drink a lot of coffee, and sometimes even serve coffee before worship at [my church](http://realitysf.com/).
A native Texan, I’m on a quest to find the closest thing to authentic Texas barbecue in the Bay Area.
