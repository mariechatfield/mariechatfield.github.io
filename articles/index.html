            <p>Profile by <a href="https://fairygodboss.com/">Fairygodboss</a> about career growth and tips.</p>
            <p><i>Marie Chatfield, a Software Engineer at Square, never expected she'd end up in her current position -- but she's thrilled that she did. She says her job has led to her growth "as an engineer but also as a whole person." Her #1 career tip is to participate in a community -- and she certainly follows her own advice. Whether she's honing her front-end development skills, interviewing interns or bonding with Square’s WomEng community and a cappella group, Marie prioritizes building relationships with a variety of her colleagues.</i></p>

She recently rallied all of our executives to sign a pledge and set an example for the rest of the company. Read on to learn more about her and why we’re excited to see her achieve her goals and be an advocate for others!</i></p>
