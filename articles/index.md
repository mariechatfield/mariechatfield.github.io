#### [Fairygodboss of the Week: Marie Chatfield](https://fairygodboss.com/articles/fairygodboss-of-the-week-marie-chatfield)

Profile by [Fairygodboss](https://fairygodboss.com/) about career growth and tips.

Whether she‚Äôs honing her front-end development skills, interviewing interns or bonding with Square‚Äôs WomEng community and a cappella group, Marie prioritizes building relationships with a variety of her colleagues.
