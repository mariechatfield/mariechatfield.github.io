## Internship Philosophy

## How to Manage an Intern

Managing an intern takes time, preparation, and a lot of communication. If you invest in spending time preparing for your intern to arrive, they'll have a great summer.


<!-- LEARNING RESOURCES -->

<div class="spacer--xl"></div>
### Learning Resources

Learning Resources: Documentation, set up steps, tutorials, and more.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Before your intern arrives, you want to collect references to different documents and resources that will help them learn about your company and your technology.

In an ideal world, your team has already been writing these resources for your own use! All of these resources are incredibly helpful for developers of all experience levels. One tried-and-true method to expanding your list of resources is to ask any new hire to write or expand on the documentation with what they wished they knew as they onboarded.

But assuming you don't already have a handy list of links lying around, do your best in the time before your intern arrives. Ask your team to contribute! 
Make sure you're covering these general categories.

You don't _have_ to have all of this written down—you can always have in-person or remote meetings to discuss these topics. But taking the time to document will give your intern a place to refresh their memory if they have questions, and make onboarding the next person faster!


<div class="spacer"></div>
#### Company Basics

What's the important information everyone needs to know about working at the company? Do you have an employee handbook? Are there paid company holidays? Do those apply to interns? Does your intern need to submit time sheets? How do they request time off or call in sick? What are the different teams at the company? What are the teams that your intern will likely be working with?

</figure>

As a [Pingboard](https://pingboard.com/) employee, I'm a big fan of our interactive org chart and vacation calendar—it helps me keep track of who's who and who's out today. But any tool or set of documents will do here, as long as you have some way to share basic information about the company with your intern!


<div class="spacer"></div>
#### Setting Up Development

How do you install the app you work on, and its dependencies? How do you run services locally? How do you run tests? What tools and software do you need access to in order to develop, and how do request access? How do you create test accounts? Do you have a specific development process in terms of how you seek code review and get your code tested and deployed?

When you're writing out instructions, __have empathy for your interns and make everything as clear and explicit as possible__.

For example, don't just say:

```md
### First Time Setup

Clone the repo and run `yarn install`

```

Break it down into every step you'd need to take to set up your app on a fresh computer, for someone who might not have used this specific technology stack before:

```md
### First Time Setup

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for Mac.

2. Clone this repository and check it out on your computer:
   `git clone https://github.com/my-org/my-repo.git`
   `cd my-repo`

3. Use Homebrew to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/):
   `brew install node`

4. Use Node to install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):
   `npm install -g yarn`

5. Install our JavaScript dependencies with Yarn:
   `yarn install`

6. Now you can run the app!
   `yarn start`

```

<div class="spacer"></div>
#### Learning the Problem Space

What is common terminology used at the company? What general information about the domain is helpful to know? What are the names of the products you ship? Who uses them? What are their use cases?

For example, if you're building tax preparation software, it would be helpful to have:

- a glossary of common tax words and phrases;
- a quick explainer about the difference between your software for individuals versus the one for businesses;
- and a list of the main models you use across the apps to represent users and filings.

<div class="spacer"></div>
#### App Specifics

What does your service architecture look like? Is everything in a giant monolith? Do you use microservices? Which ones will your intern mostly interact with?

Within the app your team is working on, what's the main structure of it? How do you find files and what's the organizational structure of your directories? What are the main components of your system? What kind of clients do you support? Web? iOS? Android? How many databases do you have and what kind are they? How do requests flow through the system?

This is a great time to draw diagrams and have some visual representations of more complex systems! They'll help _everyone_ on your team, not just your intern.

<div class="spacer"></div>
#### Best Practice

</figcaption>
</figure>

__Share responsibility for sharing knowledge.__

If you are managing or mentoring your intern, you should not be the only person responsible for teaching them and bringing them up to speed! Making sure multiple people are involved in on-boarding is better for your team and for your intern.

- __Introduce your intern to more people.__ Your intern will have more people they feel comfortable reaching out to when they have questions. And they might be able to go directly to the person with the best insight or expertise!
- __Reduce time burden on any one person.__ Ensure that a single person isn't in back-to-back meetings or conversations. Make sure to include your remote teammates too! They can be a fantastic resource to help onboard your intern.
- __Utilize the unique skill sets across your team.__ Your product manager is the best person to explain the different subscription types or user personas. Your designer is the best person to talk about the overall design system and patterns. A front-end engineer can discuss the front-end architecture; a back-end engineer can walk through the database models. Let the expertise of different members of your team shine!

__Let your intern pick their project from a list curated by your team.__

A really successful internship is one where your intern is proud of the work they have been able to accomplish, and your team had a small project completed that you might not have been able to get to otherwise. You can find a way to let your intern have some say in their work while still taking into account what your team needs!

- __Give them a sense of agency.__ Provide your intern with a short list of viable projects that are reasonable in terms of the time and experience required. But let them have the final choice! Hopefully, they'll be more invested in the project and get to work on the things that interest them most.
- __Teach them to plan and estimate.__ Encourage your intern to write a short plan for each project idea they like. Have them do a bit of research to answer "How would I implement this? What are the major steps of this project? How much time do I think each step would take? What questions or unknowns do I have?" This can give both you and your intern a better sense of which projects are a good fit for them, and teach them valuable skills they'll use in every role after about how to plan out a project.
- __Set boundaries around what tasks are a good fit.__ Your team gets to pick what projects make the list! You can make sure that the list reflects your team's priorities, and only includes things that are the right level of complexity for an intern. It can be really difficult to build a list of multiple project ideas, and there might be a few ideas that are obviously better than the others. But if you can come up with 1-2 really good ideas and 1-2 decent ideas, that's a great list to give to your intern!
