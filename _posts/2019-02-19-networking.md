In the wide, wild world of the web, there‚Äôs a lot of devices that want to talk to each other.

This blog post lives on some computer somewhere in the world, and you‚Äôre reading it on your own device in your own corner of the planet. So how did the words and pictures get from **_there_** to **_here_**?

**_Protocols_** are contracts for communication, a series of steps and actions that define a process of sending or receiving information.

Protocols are a bit like secret handshakes. You have to know your part in order for the whole thing to work. Some protocols are more complex than others, and each one has a different purpose‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou might even need to use multiple protocols, one built on top of another, to accomplish your goal!

If you‚Äôre writing web applications, you typically don‚Äôt need to worry about the exact details‚Äî most of the time, you‚Äôre going to use libraries and tools that handle the specifics. **It‚Äôs valuable to have some familiarity with the common protocols, and a general idea of what they do and when you use them!**

### Internet Protocol¬†(IP)

The [**Internet Protocol**](https://www.lifewire.com/internet-protocol-explained-3426713)  is the underlying foundation of how devices are connected and can communicate to each other across networks. It‚Äôs just one of many protocols at the [Internet layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer) of networking.

One of its primary responsibilities is routing, or passing data from a source to a recipient across the network. To this end, the Internet Protocol defines **_IP addresses‚Ää_**‚Äî‚Ääunique series of numbers that address a specific physical machine in the network.

For example, `127.0.0.1` is a special IP address that means ‚Äúthis computer,‚Äù commonly referred to as `localhost`. Most other IP addresses refer to a specific machine, and can be used to uniquely identify or fingerprint a device that is accessing the internet. You can find your device‚Äôs IP address using a tool like [WhatIsMyIP.com](https://www.whatismyip.com/).

<figure class="figure">
    <img class="figure__image" src="/blog/networking/protocols-diagram-ip.png" alt="Diagram of protocols">
    <figcaption class="figure__caption">
        Illustration of a road connecting a source and a destination building. The road is labeled Internet Layer Protocols.
    </figcaption>
</figure>


The Internet Protocol is a bit like a network of highways and streets, complete with street signs. **We can think of IP addresses as street addresses‚Ää**‚Äî‚Ääunique ways of identifying each building and destination we can interact with.

It‚Äôs worth noting that IP addresses can change! Just like street addresses aren‚Äôt geographical coordinates, IP addresses are an abstraction that helps route to a specific device.

> **Side note:** you don‚Äôt have to know IP addresses in order to visit websites thanks to the magic of the [Domain Name System (DNS)](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-dns), a protocol that maps human-readable domains like `www.mariechatfield.com` to the IP addresses where those sites can be accessed!

While the Internet Protocol is powerful and provides a great infrastructure, it doesn‚Äôt have a lot of guarantees. Roads can change, or be under construction, or shut down entirely. You can send **_packets_** (tiny chunks of data that are small enough to transmit) wherever you want, but you might not ever know whether they arrived or if they got lost in transit.

So the Internet Protocol defines a network of streets and addresses that lets you route between them, but it‚Äôs up to you to navigate. What then are the cars driving on those roads?

<div class="spacer--xl"></div>

### Transmission Control Protocol¬†(TCP)

The [**Transmission Control Protocol**](https://www.lifewire.com/tcp-transmission-control-protocol-3426736) is built on top of the Internet Protocol, and is part of the [Transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) of networking. It handles breaking larger messages into packets that can be sent across the internet, and providing some stronger guarantees about their delivery.

Have you ever seen a wind turbine in transit? A turbine is a massive structure, far too large to ship fully assembled. Each individual blade is driven on a single 18-wheeler truck to its destination, where it can be assembled and put back together.

<figure class="figure">
    <img class="figure__image" src="/blog/networking/turbine.gif" alt="Gif of wind turbine">
    <figcaption class="figure__caption" markdown="block">
Timelapse gif of a wind turbine being assembled by a crane in a field. ([source](https://giphy.com/gifs/wind-turbine-Fyt2LlluELJhC))
</figcaption>
</figure>



**If the Internet Protocol is our highway system, the Transmission Control Protocol is the shipping logistics company** that breaks down your messages into pieces that fit on its trucks, drives them to your destination, and then reassembles the whole thing for you once it arrives.

<figure class="figure">
    <img class="figure__image" src="/blog/networking/protocols-diagram-tcp.png" alt="Diagram of protocols">
    <figcaption class="figure__caption">
        Illustration of a road connecting a source and a destination building. The road is labeled Internet Layer Protocols. In between the source and destination are a series of trucks labeled Transport Layer Protocols.
    </figcaption>
</figure>


Just like trucks carrying wind turbine pieces, data packets might arrive out of order‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor some of them could get totally lost in transit. The Transmission Control Protocol has processes to handle all of these edge cases, so all you have to worry about is saying ‚Äúsend this message to this place, and let me know if it arrived in one piece or not.‚Äù

The Transmission Control Protocol defines **_ports_** as a way to identify the exact location within a physical machine where you‚Äôre sending messages. Think of an apartment building: hundreds of people share the same street address, but you want to send a package to just one of those units.

For example, you might have three servers running on your local machine‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone on port `4000`, one on port `4001`, and another on port `3200`. To send a message to the server listening to port `4000`, you would address `127.0.0.1:4000`.

In our metaphor world, the Internet Protocol is the highway system, and the Transmission Control Protocol is the shipping logistics company. However, most of us aren‚Äôt calling up the shipping logistics company directly‚Äî we go to the post office instead. Who‚Äôs the post office in this world?

<div class="spacer--xl"></div>

### Application Layer Protocols

While the Internet and Transport layer protocols provide valuable infrastructure, a lot of the really fun stuff for application developers happens at the [Application layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) of networking!

Most of these application layer protocols are implemented on top of the combination of the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol (referred to as TCP/IP), but they can use any combination of protocols that provide the basics of sending messages across the internet.

For example, [**Transport Layer Security (TLS)**](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-ssl-tls-https) is a protocol that encrypts data while in transit. Many application layer protocols offer a secure version that uses TLS in conjunction with TCP/IP to protect user data.

> **Side note:** if you‚Äôre building any kind of application that stores or sends user data, you should **absolutely without question** use TLS and other encryption protocols to protect the people who interact with your site!

> Encryption takes only a little bit more effort to set up and has immense gains for security. [Let‚Äôs Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) even offers free certificates to help you get started.

> And of course, **never ever provide your own sensitive data to a site without encryption**. Many modern browsers even show a helpful little lock at the top of a site to let you know if it‚Äôs safe to use or not!

**We can think of application layer protocols as our friendly local post offices**, which offer a wide variety of services and features to meet our needs. They provide a nice abstraction around the precise details of how our mail travels. We just know that we have a post office box that gets packages, and an easy way to post our own wind turbines and manuscripts and cat photos and travel postcards.

Some common protocols:

*   [**HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview) defines requests and responses used to send content for websites (this is our fave protocol as web developers üíõ). The encrypted version, [**HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)**](https://pagely.com/blog/http-vs-https/), uses the same request/response structure but is built on top of the TLS protocol to protect user data in transit.

<div class="spacer"></div>

*   [**Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3)**](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/email/pop3-imap-smtp-protocols-explained-ports) and [**Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)**](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/email/pop3-imap-smtp-protocols-explained-ports) allow you to retrieve emails from your email provider so you can read them locally.
*   [**Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/email/pop3-imap-smtp-protocols-explained-ports) allows you to send new emails via your email provider.
*   All three of these email protocols offer secure versions built on top of TLS to protect email content while sending messages!

<div class="spacer"></div>

*   [**Secure Shell (SSH)**](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/ssh-tutorial-how-does-ssh-work)  allows you to log onto other machines remotely and securely run commands. It‚Äôs not built on top of TLS, but uses its own encryption protocols.
*   [**File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/what-is-ftp) is a method to share and transfer files, like a remote file directory. The encrypted version, [**Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)**](https://www.wise-ftp.com/know-how/ftp_and_sftp.htm), uses the SSH protocol under the hood.

All of these protocols are useful, and using any of them depends on having a **_server_** that implements the protocol in question!

<div class="spacer--xl"></div>

### ü§î When you say _server‚Ä¶ what do you¬†mean?_

A **_server_** is just a process that continually runs on some machine somewhere in the world, listening to messages addressed to a specific TCP port, and responding in a (hopefully) expected way.

<figure class="figure">
    <img class="figure__image" src="/blog/networking/answer-the-phone.gif" alt="Gif of Alanna Thompson">
    <figcaption class="figure__caption" markdown="block">
Gif of Alana ‚ÄúHoney Boo Boo‚Äù Thompson on the TV show ‚ÄúHere Comes Honey Boo Boo‚Äù answering the phone with caption ‚ÄúHow may I help you?‚Äù¬†([source](https://giphy.com/gifs/told-Qp0cpdTzTrfdC))
</figcaption>
</figure>

Most protocols specify which port they expect an implementing server to listen to‚Äî for example, HTTP servers are usually on port `80` and SSH servers are on port `22`.

You can have multiple servers running on the same physical machine! For example, you might have an HTTP server running your main web application, an FTP server to host large files, and IMAP and SMTP servers running your own private email system.

Most of the time in the web development world, we use **_server_** as a shorthand for ‚ÄúHTTP server‚Äù, but it‚Äôs helpful to remember that‚Äôs not the only kind of server or protocol out there. But since HTTP is our bread and butter as web developers, let‚Äôs dive a bit deeper into the details!

<div class="spacer--xl"></div>

## ‚ú® HTTP-topia is a magical place¬†‚ú®

HTTP is the primary application layer protocol we use as web developers to retrieve resources to render websites. Everything (and I do mean _everything_) in a website is delivered via HTTP to the browser, from HTML and images to JavaScript files and data.

HTTP defines two message types: **_requests_** and **_responses_**. A client makes a request to a server, and the server sends back a response.

A **_client_** is anything that makes a request‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääusually a browser, but servers can also make HTTP requests to other servers! A client can also be something like a web crawler bot or a command-line tool like [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/faq.html#What_is_cURL).

**If HTTP is our local post office, requests and responses are the postcards!**

</figcaption>
</figure>



Every postcard has a specific format and some fields that must be filled out in order to be sent.

The data flow is one-way, though. **The client always make requests to the server‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe server never initiates a request back.** This means with HTTP you can‚Äôt ‚Äúpush‚Äù data to the client magically‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou either have to poll the server by sending repeated requests over a set interval, or use a different protocol that does support two-way connections, like [Websockets](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/an-introduction-to-websockets).

HTTP requests and responses are also **_stateless_**, which means that there isn‚Äôt any context shared between requests. Every request the client makes to the server is independent of any previous requests. The client can always include information in its requests that the server can use to identify it, and decide how to respond though! (That‚Äôs the point of [**_cookies_**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies).)

### Anatomy of a¬†Request

A **_request_** is sent from the client, to the server, to start off a communication cycle.

<figure class="figure">

</figcaption>
</figure>


Requests contain the following fields:

*   **VERSION:** the exact version of the protocol being used

*   **METHOD:** the type of action the client wants to take

*   **PATH:** a URL that indicates what the client wants to take action on

*   **HEADERS:** optional metadata about the request

*   **BODY:** optional data

<div class="spacer--xl"></div>

### Anatomy of a¬†Response

A **_response_** is sent from the server, to the client, to complete a communication cycle.

<figure class="figure">

</figcaption>
</figure>

Responses contain the following fields:

*   **VERSION:** the exact version of the protocol being used

*   **STATUS CODE:** a number that indicates whether if the success was successful, or why not

*   **STATUS MESSAGE:** a short description of the status code

*   **HEADERS:** optional metadata about the response

*   **BODY:** optional data

Let‚Äôs define these fields in more detail!

<div class="spacer--xl"></div>

### Fields for both HTTP Requests and Responses

#### VERSION

The exact version of the protocol the client is using, used in both requests and responses.

Most often version HTTP/1.1, but [HTTP/2](https://kinsta.com/learn/what-is-http2/) is also possible! If the server doesn‚Äôt support the version of the protocol the client wants to use, it may not be able to understand or respond to the request.

#### HEADERS

**Optional** pieces of metadata about the request or the response.

Usually, **_headers_ contain information about the request/response itself**, or preferences and options the client or server would like to communicate. Each request and response can contain multiple **_headers_**, or string key-value pairs.

```
Accept: application/json
```

This header is traditionally set on a request to indicates that the client wants the response data formatted as a JSON string. (The server still can do whatever it wants‚Ä¶ but the client did ask politely.)

**_Headers_** can also be used to pass authentication data, set caching or Do Not Track preferences, pass cookies, indicate the application/operating system of the client, and [much more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers).

</figcaption>
</figure>



#### BODY

**Optional** data passed along with a request or a response.

```json
{
  "name": "fire",
  "emoji": "üî•"
}
```

Traditionally, `GET` requests use the URL **_path_** and **_query strings_** to pass data about what kinds of resources they want, and `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH` requests use the **_body_**.

Since responses don‚Äôt have a URL, they always pass data about the response via the **_body_** if the status code alone is insufficient information.

However, HTTP does allow you set the **_body_** of any request or response, so you can do what you want. If you do pass data here, you‚Äôll probably want to include a `Content-Type` **_header_** to tell the recipient how to parse your string content!

<div class="spacer--xl"></div>

### Fields for HTTP Requests¬†only

<figure class="figure">

</figcaption>
</figure>

#### METHOD

A word, usually a verb, that indicates what kind of action the client wants to take. **Only set on requests!**

Some common methods include:

*   **GET:** fetch some data
*   **POST:** create new data
*   **PUT:** modify existing data
*   **DELETE:** remove data
*   **OPTIONS:** return what methods are supported
*   [and more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)!

Note that just because you can send a valid HTTP **_method_** to a server, doesn‚Äôt mean the server has to support that **_method_** for that URL‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor that it has to take the action you request.

I could decide to write a server where calling `GET /emojis` deletes all the users in the database. This would be decidedly un-fun and you probably wouldn‚Äôt want to use my server, but it‚Äôs still a valid HTTP request/response.

The HTTP protocol doesn‚Äôt enforce that a server **must** respond to any of these **_methods_**, or what the implementation does‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit just provides a list of options which is flexible enough to create whatever kind of contract you want.

#### PATH

The full URL, or where the client wants to take the action. **Only set on requests!**

**_Paths_** allow the sever to support multiple different types of data and resources! For example, I might want to serve `/emojis`, `/gifs`, and `/puppies` as separate endpoints.

```
https://www.mycoolsite.com/emojis?type=food
```

Let‚Äôs break down this sample URL:

*   `https://` indicates the protocol we‚Äôre using (sometimes also called a **_scheme_**)
*   `www.mycoolsite.com` is the domain name, which will be translated by DNS into an IP address belonging to the physical host which is running the HTTP server for that address
*   `/emojis` is the **_relative path_** we want to access on that host
*   `?type=food` is a **_query string_**, or a set of name-value pairs that give extra information about our request

Note that we didn‚Äôt specify a TCP port here! By default, HTTP requests will be directed to port `80`. We could rewrite the same URL with the port specified as:

```
https://www.mycoolsite.com:80/emojis?type=food
```

<div class="spacer--xl"></div>

### Fields for HTTP Responses only

</figcaption>
</figure>



#### STATUS CODE

A number that indicates whether the request was successful, or why not. **Only set on responses!**

*   100-level responses are **informational** and just tell you metadata about the request.
*   200-level responses are **successful** and indicate everything went well! Common examples include `200 (OK)` and `201 (Created)`.
*   300-level responses are **redirections** and indicate that the request won‚Äôt be completed. This isn‚Äôt necessarily an error. Common examples include `301 (Moved permanently)` for paths that have changed, and `304 (Not modified)` for cached content that hasn‚Äôt been updated.
*   400-level responses are **client errors**. Common examples include `400 (Bad request)`, `404 (Not Found)`, and `403 (Forbidden)` for requests that are malformed, trying to access things that don‚Äôt exist, or that they don‚Äôt have proper authentication and authorization for.
*   500-level responses are **server errors**. `500 (Internal server error)` usually means the server has a bug, or `503 (Service unavailable)` often indicates the server is down.

Just like **_methods_**, HTTP doesn‚Äôt require servers to use these codes correctly. There are certain expectations that servers will response with the code that matches a given scenario, but they can use whatever code they want to and you can‚Äôt stop them.

It‚Äôs probably not worth memorizing a bunch of these codes, although you‚Äôll certainly gain familiarity with the common ones over time. I like using sites with pictures for each code when I need to quickly reference which code to use.

[**HTTPBey**](https://httbey.com/#%F0%9F%90%9D) **has Beyonc√© gifs** for common status codes, and [**HTTP.cat**](https://http.cat/) **has some rad cat pics** (and you can easily access specific codes like [http.cat/200](https://http.cat/200)).

#### STATUS MESSAGE

A short description of the status code. **Only set on responses!**

To help you remember what a status code is for, a short string is also set as the status message.

You should always depend on the numerical code in your application logic that handles responses, as servers can return whatever message they want and it may vary! But the text can be very helpful for quick debugging.

## üë©üèª‚Äçüè´ Let's Review!

<figure class="figure">

</figcaption>
</figure>



That was a lot of learning! Let‚Äôs review what we learned.

*   **_Protocols_** are communication contracts. They provide different levels of abstraction, and we use lots of different protocols in order to send and receive data on the internet.

<figure class="figure">
    <img class="figure__image" src="/blog/networking/protocols-diagram.png" alt="Diagram of protocols">
    <figcaption class="figure__caption">

    </figcaption>
</figure>


*   The **_Internet layer protocols_** (like the Internet Protocol, or IP) form the basic infrastructure of communicating between physical devices on a network (like roads and street addresses).

*   The **_Transport layer protocols_** (like the Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP) provide an abstraction around sending data. TCP in particular provides stronger guarantees about whether a message has arrived and ensures all the packets are assembled again in the right order (like a shipping logistics company).
  
*   The **_Application layer protocols_** (like the HyperText Transfer Protocol, or HTTP) are built on top of the other protocol stacks, like TCP/IP. They offer more specific features and abstractions for application purposes (like a local post office).

*   A **_server_** is any process running on a physical machine that listens to a specific port and implements a particular protocol. Web developers usually mean ‚ÄúHTTP server‚Äù when we say server, but you could also have an FTP or SSH server, etc.

    <figcaption class="figure__caption" markdown="block">
Illustration of an HTTP POST request as a postcard. It uses HTTP/1.1, has a path of `/emojis`, with headers `Accept: application/json; Content-Type: application/json`. The body contains a JSON string with a fire emoji icon and name. The postcard is addressed ‚ÄúDear server‚Äù and signed ‚ÄúLove, the¬†client‚Äù.

*   **_HTTP_** is the application layer protocol most web developers interact with on a daily basis. **_HTTPS_** is the secure encrypted version, which you should always use to protect your users‚Äô data!

*   HTTP consists of **_request_** and **_response_** pairs. **_Clients_** send requests, and **_servers_** send back responses. (Like postcards sent via our local post office!)

*   As developers, we expect that requests and responses are used in a particular way‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälike sending `GET` requests to fetch data and returning a `200` response to indicate a successful request‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut HTTP does not require servers to implement specific behaviors! Servers can choose to do weird things, so be sure you understand the rules and contracts and options available to you before sending requests.

Now go forth and network with confidence! üéâ
